# Location Profile

## The Hostel

**Name:** Gaia's Sanctuary Eco-Hostel
**Type:** Eco / Spiritual / Budget
**Star Rating:** 3 (self-rated; actual conditions vary)
**Price Range:** 15-30 EUR per night

### History
Built in 1890 as a merchant's home. Converted to boarding house post-WWII. Purchased in 2015 by German idealists who dreamed of creating "a healing space for conscious travelers." They renovated the upper floors but ran out of money before addressing the basement's structural moisture problems. They tell themselves it's "good enough" and "connects guests to the earth."

### Architecture

### The Death Location (Specific)
Basement "Grounding Room." Eight beds arranged in two rows. Original stone walls (damp), wooden floor over dirt (moisture seeps through), small ground-level windows (don't open properly). Black mold visible in corners, behind peeling wallpaper, under beds. Musty smell masked by incense. Temperature: cool year-round (feels "grounding," actually sign of moisture). Sage's bed: bottom bunk in corner, headboard against wall with worst mold concentration.

## The City

**Country:** England, UK

## Sensory Environment

### Sounds
- Morning: Birdsong, distant church bells, chanting from nearby retreat center
- Afternoon: Wind chimes, tour groups on High Street, buskers playing healing bowls
- Night: Eerie silence, occasional fox screams, wind around the Tor
- Unique sounds: The basement drips when it rains; everyone pretends not to notice

### Smells
- Hostel: Incense (nag champa, sage—ironic), essential oils, mildew beneath it all
- Street: Health food shops, crystal shops, vegetarian cafes, rain on old stone
- Specific to death location: Damp earth, mold (sharp, earthy), essential oils failing to mask decay

### Textures
- Surfaces: Cold stone walls, worn wooden floors, soft tapestries and throws everywhere
- Climate feel: Persistent dampness, chill that warmth can't touch, moisture in the air

### Tastes
- Local food: Vegetarian/vegan cafes, organic everything, ceremonial cacao, herbal teas
- Hostel offerings: Free herbal tea, communal vegan dinners (extra cost), foraged breakfast items

### Visual Details
- Colors: Earth tones, purples, lots of rainbow imagery, stone grey, green moss
- Light quality: Diffused through mist, golden sunset on the Tor, dim in the basement
- Distinctive visuals: Crystals everywhere, dream catchers, the Tor visible from rooftop, suspicious dark patches on basement walls

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Luna (born: Linda) Pemberton
**Description:** 52, former corporate lawyer, found spirituality after burnout. Genuinely believes in the hostel's mission. Wears flowing garments and speaks in a permanent gentle tone. In denial about basement conditions.
**Role in death:** Enabler through denial. Dismissed moisture complaints as guests "not being grounded enough." Should have closed basement years ago.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Jarek | Polish, practical, has reported mold multiple times, ignored |
| Kitchen | Willow | 24, intern from London, true believer, makes terrible but sincere vegan food |
| Maintenance | Barry | Local, not spiritual at all, just needs the work, knows basement is unsafe |
| Owners | The Hartleys | German couple, visit twice yearly, always mean to address basement "next season" |

### Staff Knowledge
Barry knows the basement is a health hazard—he's said so repeatedly. Jarek has documented the mold. Luna knows but has spiritually bypassed the problem ("the Earth is just expressing herself"). The Hartleys know but haven't prioritized the expense. Everyone is complicit through inaction.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Dreamy and earnest. Guests meditate in the garden, swap spiritual experiences, debate the best crystal shops. It feels like a wellness retreat for people who can't afford actual retreats. Genuinely warm community—just built on shaky (and moldy) foundations.

### Night Vibe
Mystical. Candles, soft music, group meditations. The basement feels "sacred"—cool, dark, womb-like. Easy to romanticize. Harder to breathe properly, but everyone assumes that's just them.

### Guest Demographics
Spiritual seekers (majority), festival overflow (summer), hikers/tourists (minority), long-term "volunteers" who work for accommodation. Average age: 34. Average stay: 4-7 nights. Repeat visitors common.

### Reputation
Reviews split: "Magical energy!" / "Transformed my life!" / "Basement smells musty" / "Beautiful people but suspicious walls." People who complain are labeled as "not open to the energy."

## Practical Details

### Getting There
Train to Castle Cary or bus to Glastonbury town center. 10-minute walk from High Street, down a lane that feels deliberately hidden. Sign has a crescent moon. You'll walk past three crystal shops on the way.

### Check-in Process
Luna offers tea and asks about your "intention for your stay." Tour includes explanation of house rules (vegan kitchen, silence hours, shoes off). Basement presented as "deeply grounding space—perfect for those seeking Earth connection."

### Rules
1. Shoes off inside
2. Vegan/vegetarian kitchen only
3. Silence hours: 22:00-08:00
4. No "negative energy" in common spaces
5. Basement guests asked to "honor the space" (don't complain about dampness)

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: good but "electronics discouraged")
- [x] Kitchen (vegan only)
- [x] Lockers (limited)
- [ ] Laundry (hand wash recommended "for the planet")
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar (no alcohol)
- [x] Rooftop (yoga deck)
- [x] Tours offered (Tor walks, sacred site tours)
- [x] Other: Daily meditation, weekly sound healing, crystal lending library

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Glastonbury's spiritual tourism industry is accurately depicted
- Mold problems in old UK buildings are common and often ignored
- The type of hostel described (earnest but underfunded eco-spot) exists
- Stachybotrys chartarum thrives in exactly these conditions
- UK building regulations regarding damp/mold are often unenforced in older properties

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Mock the wellness industry, not sincere spirituality
- Avoid implying all alternative medicine is harmful (just the extremes)
- British readers should recognize Glastonbury fondly while acknowledging its absurdities
- The victim is satirized, but her death should still evoke genuine tragedy

### Sources
- Glastonbury tourism information
- UK building moisture/mold guidelines
- News reports on toxic mold cases
- Reviews of actual Glastonbury hostels
- Wellness culture critiques
